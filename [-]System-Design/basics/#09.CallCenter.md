### #09. Call Center


#### Constraints and assumptions
* What levels of employees are in the call center?
    * Operator, supervisor, director
* Can we assume operators always get the initial calls?
    * Yes
* If there is no available operators or the operator can't handle the call, does the call go to the supervisors?
    * Yes
* If there is no available supervisors or the supervisor can't handle the call, does the call go to the directors?
    * Yes
* Can we assume the directors can handle all calls?
    * Yes
* What happens if nobody can answer the call?
    * It gets queued
* Do we need to handle 'VIP' calls where we put someone to the front of the line?
    * No
* Can we assume inputs are valid or do we have to validate them?
    * Assume they're valid

#Output
Call 1 assigned to employee Modi
Call 1 is now attended by Modi
Call 2 assigned to employee Harsh
Call 2 is now attended by Harsh
Call 1  has been completed by Modi
Call 3 assigned to employee Modi
Call 3 is now attended by Modi
