### #04. Minimum Window Substring

Leetcode link: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/

- Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively. 
- Return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window.

```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```


**Solution**
```cpp
string minWindow(string s, string t) {
    unordered_map<char, int> freq;
    for(char ch: t) freq[ch]++;

    int i = 0, j = 0, counter = t.size(), minStart = 0, minLen = INT_MAX;

    while(i < s.size()){
        // char of s exists in t
        if(freq[s[i]] > 0)
            counter--;

        // non-values of t would be negative
        freq[s[i]]--;

        // for all valid winodws
        while(counter == 0){
            if(i-j+1 < minLen){
                minStart = j;
                minLen = i-j+1;
            }

            //start reducing window from begining and check validity
            // if the s[j] was already part of t string, it would be back to +ve
            freq[s[j]]++;
            if(freq[s[j]] > 0)
                counter++;
            j++;
        }
        i++;
    }

    return minLen == INT_MAX ? "" : s.substr(minStart, minLen);
}
```
