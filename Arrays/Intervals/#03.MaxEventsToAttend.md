Leetcode link: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended/

**Code ~O(NLogN)**
```cpp
int maxEvents(vector<vector<int>>& events) {
    sort(begin(events), end(events));
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;

    int res = 0, i = 0, n = events.size();
    for(int day=1; day <= 1e5; day++){
        //all events that are ready to attend from today
        while(i<n && events[i][0] == day){
            pq.push(events[i][1]);
            i++;
        }

        //remove all events before today
        while(!pq.empty() && pq.top() < day) pq.pop();

        //choose any to attend today (the one that end soon)
        if(!pq.empty()){
            res++;
            pq.pop();
        }
    }
    return res;
