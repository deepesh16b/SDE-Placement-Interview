### #39. Total Appeal of A String

Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/total-appeal-of-a-string/

```
The appeal of a string is the number of distinct characters found in the string.

For example, the appeal of "abbca" is 3 because it has 3 distinct characters: 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
Given a string s, return the total appeal of all of its substrings.

Input: s = "abbca"
Output: 28
```

**Regarding the distinct characters counting**:
- We are basically checking each 'characters' contribution to its created substrings.
- If there is a repeating character later on, you will see that the `repeating character`'s contribution would be double-counted - if you take all of its substrings contribution. (see 2nd image)
- Since we want just the distinct character count (and not repeated counts), we count only substrings formed from `next index` of prev occurred character.

**Easy Method**
```cpp
long long appealSum(string s) {
    long long res = 0, n = s.size();
    vector<int> prev(26, -1); //-1 is important (becuz we require (i+1) in formula)

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        res += (i - prev[s[i] - 'a']) * (n - i);
        prev[s[i] - 'a'] = i;
    }

    return res;
}
```

#### By DP Inspection

The **(i+1)** = new characters added = also count of new substrings added.
Here we are reducing those newly added characters (from prev index) - since it's result is already accumulated - thus we get only the new distinct characters count at repeating characters index.

Eg. At index 4, we are adding **5 new 'b' chars**, but we had counted the 'b' at index 2, and is seen here at `bcab & abcab` substrings. This would get redundant if we count again. So we reduce the new added 'b' chars count => (5 - 2) = 3.

```cpp
long long appealSum(string s) {
    long long n = s.size(), res = 0, prevTot = 0;
    vector<int> prev(26, 0);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        char chi = s[i] - 'a';
        prevTot += (i + 1) - prev[chi];
        res += prevTot;
        prev[chi] = i + 1;
    }

    return res;
}
```

#### Atmost K Trick
- Maximum count of repeating chars is 1 <= cnt <= 26
- We thus find how many substrings with `cnt` distinct characters.
