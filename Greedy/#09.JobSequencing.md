### #09. Job Sequencing

Problem link: https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/job-sequencing-problem/

```
Input: N = 4, Jobs = {(1,4,20),(2,1,10),(3,1,40),(4,1,30)}

Output: 2 60

Explanation: The 3rd job with a deadline 1 is performed during the first unit of time.
The 1st job is performed during the second unit of time as its deadline is 4.
Profit = 40 + 20 = 60
```

**Solution**
```cpp
void solve(vector<vector<int>>& arr) {
    int maxi = INT_MIN;
    for (auto& v : arr)
        maxi = max(maxi, v[1]);

    // sort by descending of profit
    sort(begin(arr), end(arr), [](auto & a, auto & b) {
        return a[2] > b[2];
    });

    // take the available slot <= deadline day
    vector<int> bookings(maxi, -1);
    int profit = 0;
    for (auto& v : arr) {
        for (int j = v[1]; j >= 0; j--) {
            if (bookings[j - 1] == -1) {
                bookings[j - 1] = v[0];
                profit += v[2];
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    printVectors(bookings);
    cout << profit << endl;
}
```
