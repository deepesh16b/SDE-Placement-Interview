**C++ Solution**
```cpp
int diameter = 0;
int findHeights(TreeNode* root){
    if(!root) return 0;

    int lHeight = findHeights(root->left);
    int rHeight = findHeights(root->right);

    diameter = max(diameter, lHeight + rHeight);
    return 1 + max(lHeight, rHeight);
}

int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
    findHeights(root);
    return diameter;
}
```
