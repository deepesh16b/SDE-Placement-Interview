### #17. Course Schedule

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

**Python - Using Kahns Alog (Not recommended)**
```python
from queue import Queue
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, n: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        indegree = [0] * n
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for u,v in prerequisites:
            indegree[u] += 1
            graph[v].append(u)
        
        q = Queue()
        count = 0

        for i in range(n):
            if indegree[i] == 0:
                q.put(i)
        
        while not q.empty():
            node = q.get()
            count += 1

            for child in graph[node]:
                indegree[child] -= 1
                if indegree[child] == 0:
                    q.put(child)
        
        return count == n

```
