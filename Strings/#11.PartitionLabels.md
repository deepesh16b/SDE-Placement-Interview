### #11. Partition Labels

You are given a string s. 
We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.

Leetcode link: https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/

```
Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.
```

**Code**
```cpp
vector<int> partitionLabels(string s) {
    vector<int> lastOccur(26, -1);
    //store the last occurence of chars
    for(int i=0; i< s.size(); i++)
        lastOccur[s[i]-'a'] = i;

    int start = 0, charEnd = 0;
    vector<int> res;
    for(int i=0; i<s.size(); i++){
        //keep finding the maximum ending idx of visiting chars
        charEnd = max(charEnd, lastOccur[s[i]-'a']);
        if(charEnd == i){
            res.push_back(i-start+1);
            start = i+1;
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```
