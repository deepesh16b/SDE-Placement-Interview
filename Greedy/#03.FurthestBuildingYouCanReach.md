### #03. Furthest Building You Can Reach

Leetcode link: https://leetcode.com/problems/furthest-building-you-can-reach/

While moving from building i to building i+1 (0-indexed),
- If the current building's height is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you do not need a ladder or bricks.
- If the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you can either use one ladder or (h[i+1] - h[i]) bricks.

**C++ Code**
```cpp
int furthestBuilding(vector<int>& h, int bricks, int ladders) {
    priority_queue<int> pq;

    for(int i=0; i<h.size()-1; i++){
        if(h[i] >= h[i+1]) continue;

        bricks -= h[i+1] - h[i];
        pq.push(h[i+1] - h[i]);

        if(bricks < 0){
            bricks += pq.top(); pq.pop();
            if(ladders > 0) ladders--;
            else return i;
        }
    }

    return h.size()-1;
}
```
