### #29. Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together II


```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0]
Output: 1

Input: nums = [1,1,0,0,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: All the 1's are already grouped together due to the circular property of the array.
```

```cpp
int minSwaps(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int onesCount = 0;
	
	//count total number of ones '1'
    for (auto num : nums)
        if (num == 1) onesCount++;

    int leastSwap = INT_MAX;
    map<int, int> mpp;
    
	//starting sliding window
	for (int i = 0; i < n + onesCount; i++) {
		//i%n is for circular array eg. [1,0,0,1,1] -> 1,1,1 already together.
        mpp[nums[i % n]]++;
        if (i >= onesCount) {
            mpp[nums[i - onesCount]]--;
            leastSwap = min(leastSwap, mpp[0]);
			//the logic is to count the number of '0's in the sliding window.
        }
    }

    return leastSwap;
}
```
