### #27. Allocate Minimum No. of pages

```
Given number of pages in n different books and m students. The books are arranged in ascending order of number of pages. Every student is assigned to read some consecutive books. The task is to assign books in such a way that the maximum number of pages assigned to a student is minimum.

Example :

Input : pages[] = {12, 34, 67, 90}
        m = 2
Output : 113
Explanation:
There are 2 number of students. Books can be distributed 
in following fashion : 
  1) [12] and [34, 67, 90]
      Max number of pages is allocated to student 
      2 with 34 + 67 + 90 = 191 pages
  2) [12, 34] and [67, 90]
      Max number of pages is allocated to student
      2 with 67 + 90 = 157 pages 
  3) [12, 34, 67] and [90]
      Max number of pages is allocated to student 
      1 with 12 + 34 + 67 = 113 pages

Of the 3 cases, Option 3 has the minimum pages = 113.

```
bool isValid(vector<int>& nums, int noOfStudents, int sepPages) {
    // cout << sepPages << endl;
    int sum = 0, k = 1;
    for (auto num : nums) {
        if (num > sepPages) return false;

        sum += num;
        if (sum > sepPages) {
            k++;
            sum = num;
            if (k < noOfStudents) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int findPages(vector<int>& nums, int noOfStudents) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (noOfStudents > n) return -1;

    int maxNum = INT_MIN, sum = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        sum += num;
        if (num > maxNum)
            maxNum = num;
    }

    int lo = maxNum, hi = sum;
    int res = -1;
    while (lo <= hi) {
        int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
        if (isValid(nums, noOfStudents, mid)) {
            res = mid;
            hi = mid - 1;
        } else
            lo = mid + 1;
    }

    return res == -1 ? -1 : sum - res;
}
```
