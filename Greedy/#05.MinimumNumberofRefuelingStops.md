Leetcode link: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-refueling-stops/

- Return the minimum number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination. 
- If it cannot reach the destination, return -1.



```
Input: target = 100, startFuel = 10, stations = [[10,60],[20,30],[30,30],[60,40]]
Output: 2
```

**Code**
```cpp
int minRefuelStops(int target, int startFuel, vector<vector<int>>& stations) {
    int curFuel = startFuel, res = 0;
    stations.push_back({target, 0});
    priority_queue<int> pq;

    for(int i=0; i<stations.size(); i++){
        //greedily take the one that gives max fuel
        while(curFuel < stations[i][0]){
            if(pq.empty())
                return -1;
            curFuel += pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            res++;
        }
        pq.push(stations[i][1]);
    }
    return res;
}
