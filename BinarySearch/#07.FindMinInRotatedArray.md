**Code**
```cpp
int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size(), lo = 0, hi = n-1;
    
    // eg. [4,5,1,2,3]
    // when mid -> value 1, we know all above 1 are greater.
    // we skip all after, but include the current mid
    
    while(lo < hi){
        int mid = lo + (hi-lo)/2;
        if(nums[mid] < nums[hi])
            hi = mid;
        else
            lo = mid + 1;
    }
    return nums[lo];
}
