### #24. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.
- Remember the **"NO NEED TO TAKE FULL PATH", PARTIAL PATH WORKS**
- Even a single node can be the answer

```
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
```


**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        self.maxSum = float("-inf")
        
        def dfs(node):
            if not node: return 0

            # Think before including the child node, so better to 0 it out.
            leftSum = max(0, dfs(node.left))
            rightSum =  max(0, dfs(node.right))

            # The max sum is calculated - left + right + cur node value 
            self.maxSum = max(self.maxSum, node.val + leftSum + rightSum)

            # Return only the one side max sum (leftSum or rightSum)
            return node.val + max(leftSum, rightSum)
         
        dfs(root)
        return self.maxSum
```
