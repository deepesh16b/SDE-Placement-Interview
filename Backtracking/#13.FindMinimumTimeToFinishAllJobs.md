### #13.  Find Minimum Time to Finish All Jobs

Leetcode link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-time-to-finish-all-jobs/

```
Input: jobs = [3,2,3], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: By assigning each person one job, the maximum time is 3.
```

Prune techniques
- prune1: when we have current woker sum of jobs more than the global max, we stop
- prune2: when we assign a new job to several wokers who has same work load, we only need to pick one, and stop others recursive call.

Suppose, we have the following workload for 10 workers,
`workers = [10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`

- if we want to assign the current task jobs[curr] to someone,
- it makes no difference if we assign it to any worker whose current workload is 5.

**C++ Solution**
```cpp
vector<int> workers;
int ans = INT_MAX;

void solve(vector<int>& jobs, int idx, int curMax) {
    if (idx == jobs.size()) {
        ans = min(ans, curMax);
        return;
    }

    if (curMax > ans) return;

    for (int i = 0; i < workers.size(); i++) {
        if (i > 0 && workers[i] == workers[i - 1]) continue;
        workers[i] += jobs[idx];
        solve(jobs, idx + 1, max(workers[i], curMax));
        workers[i] -= jobs[idx];
    }
}

int minimumTimeRequired(vector<int>& jobs, int k) {
    workers.resize(k);
    solve(jobs, 0, INT_MIN);
    return ans;
}
```
