### #02. Longest Well Performing Interval

Leetcode link - https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-well-performing-interval/

Steps:
- Convert each hour state of 1 or -1; and take prefix sum.
- We need "more 1s" and "less -1s", which means best interval will have sum > 0
- To get intermediate intervals, we can take hours[0:i] which is negative and subtract hours[0:j] whose pref sum diff gives sum > 0.
- Like.. `sum - (sum-1) = 1` which is `> 0`, can be considered in interval.

**C++ Code**
```cpp
int longestWPI(vector<int>& hours) {
    unordered_map<int, int> mp;
    int sum = 0, maxLen = 0;

    for(int i=0; i<hours.size(); i++){
        sum += hours[i] > 8 ? 1 : -1;
        if(!mp.count(sum))
            mp[sum] = i;

        if(sum > 0)
            maxLen = i+1;
        else if(mp.count(sum-1))
            maxLen = max(maxLen, i-mp[sum-1]);
    }

    return maxLen;
}
```
