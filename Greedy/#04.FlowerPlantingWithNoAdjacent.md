### #04. Flower Planting With No Adjacent

Leetcode link: https://leetcode.com/problems/flower-planting-with-no-adjacent/

- You have n gardens, labeled from 1 to n. All gardens have at most 3 paths coming into or leaving it.
- Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.
(Flowers - 1,2,3,4)

Why it works?
- This solution works because - 3 incoming/outgoing nodes are present and we have 4 colors
- Obviously, 1 color would be "remaining". greedy it.

**Code**
```cpp
vector<int> gardenNoAdj(int n, vector<vector<int>>& paths) {
    vector<vector<int>> graph(n);
    for (auto& p : paths) {
        graph[p[0] - 1].push_back(p[1] - 1);
        graph[p[1] - 1].push_back(p[0] - 1);
    }

    vector<int> res(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        vector<int> colors(5);
        
        //mark all the neighbours as colored,
        //to see which color remains
        for (int child : graph[i])
            colors[res[child]] = 1;

        //take the left over color
        for (int c = 4; c >= 1; c--) {
            if (colors[c] != 1)
                res[i] = c;
        }
    }

    return res;
}
```
