**O(N) - Two Sum (Prefix Sum)**
```cpp
unordered_map<long, long> mp;
int pathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
    mp[0] = 1;
    return helper(root, 0, targetSum);
}

int helper(TreeNode* root, long sum, int targetSum){
    if(!root) return 0;

    sum = (long) sum + root->val;
    int res = mp.count(sum - targetSum) ? mp[sum-targetSum] : 0;

    mp[sum]++;
    res += helper(root->left, sum, targetSum);
    res += helper(root->right, sum, targetSum);
    mp[sum]--;

    return res;
}
```

Q. Why `mp[sum]--;`?
1. First the pathsum is incremented with sum till the current node.
2. Now it moves to "left subtree", and processes the loop with increment and go on with its new pathsum.. let that go.
3. But wait, In this current iteration, when the chance comes for "right subtree" iteration, oops, the prefixSum was modified deep down in the left subtree.
4. We need to revert that, that's why we decrement - as the pathsum need to go back till the current node.

**O(N^2) Solution** 
```cpp
int dfs(TreeNode* root, long sum){
    if(!root) return 0;
    sum = (long) sum - root->val;
    return (sum == 0) + dfs(root->left, sum) + 
        dfs(root->right, sum);
}

int pathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
    if(!root) return 0;
    return dfs(root, targetSum) + pathSum(root->left, targetSum) + 
        pathSum(root->right, targetSum);
}
```
