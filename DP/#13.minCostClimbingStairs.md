### #13.minCostClimbingStairs

```
Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: You will start at index 0.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.

```cpp
unordered_map <int, int> mp;
int minCostClimbingStairs(vector<int>& cost, int n, int pos) {
    if (pos >= n) return 0;

    if (mp.find(pos) != mp.end())
        return mp[pos];

    mp[pos] = cost[pos] + min(minCostClimbingStairs(cost, n, pos + 1),
                              minCostClimbingStairs(cost, n, pos + 2));
    return mp[pos];
}

int minCostClimbingStairs(vector<int>& cost) {
    int n = cost.size();
    return min(minCostClimbingStairs(cost, n, 0), minCostClimbingStairs(cost, n, 1));
}
