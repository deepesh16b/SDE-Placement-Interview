```
Input: n = 6 
arr[] = {0900, 0940, 0950, 1100, 1500, 1800}
dep[] = {0910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000}
Output: 3 platforms
```

**Solution**
```cpp
int findPlatform(int arr[], int dep[], int n){
    # Need to sort separately to get the answer
    sort(arr, arr+n);
    sort(dep, dep+n);
    
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    int res = 0, cnt = 0;

    # This waits till the previous train leaves, otherwise adds new platform
    while(i < n && j < n){
        if(arr[i] <= dep[j]){
            cnt++;
            i++;
        }
        else{
            cnt--;
            j++;
        }
        res = max(res, cnt);
    }
    
    return res;
}
```
