### #20. Number of People Aware of a Secret

Leetcode link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-people-aware-of-a-secret/


- On day 1, one person discovers a secret.
- You are given an integer delay, which means that each person will share the secret with a new person every day, starting from delay days after discovering. 
- You are also given an integer forget, which means that each person will forget the secret forget days after discovering it. 
- A person cannot share the secret on the same day they forgot it, or on any day afterwards.

Given an integer n, return the number of people who know the secret at the end of day n. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Solution Steps:
- `dp` represents the "newly added people" who got to know the secret that day.
- `dp[1]` will be the first day having count = 1
- `dp[i]` = (share) willing to share people + (i-delay) knowing people - (i-forget) forgetting people. 
- These three states are important to this problem.

**Solution**
```cpp
int peopleAwareOfSecret(int n, int delay, int forget) {
    vector<long> dp(n+1);
    long res = 0, share = 0, mod = 1e9 + 7;
    dp[1] = 1;

    for(int i=2; i<=n; i++){
        share = (share + dp[max(i-delay, 0)] - dp[max(i-forget, 0)] + mod)%mod;
        dp[i] = share;
    }

    for(int i=n-forget+1; i <= n; i++)
        res = (res + dp[i])%mod;
    return res;
}
```
