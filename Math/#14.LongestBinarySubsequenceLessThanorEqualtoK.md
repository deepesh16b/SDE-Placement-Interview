### #14. Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than or Equal to K

Leetcode link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-binary-subsequence-less-than-or-equal-to-k/

- For longest subsequence, We can include as many zeros = whose overall value will always be <= K.
- To include more in subsequence, We carefully try inserting 1 at its LSB and see if it outruns the K sum.
- So greedy works great here.

**C++ Code**
```cpp
int longestSubsequence(string s, int k) {
        int n = s.size(), res = 0, sum = 0;
        for(int i=n-1; i>=0; i--){
            int num = s[i]-'0';
            if(num == 0)
                res++;
            else{
                int j = n-i-1;
                if(sum + pow(2, j) <= k){
                    sum += pow(2, j);
                    res++;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```
