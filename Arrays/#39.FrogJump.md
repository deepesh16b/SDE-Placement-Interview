Input: stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
Output: true
Explanation: The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 1 unit to the 2nd stone, 
then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 
4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.
```

**C++ Code**
```cpp
bool canCross(vector<int>& stones) {
    //(pos -> jumps possible) map is created
    map<int, unordered_set<int>> mp;
    for(int& stone: stones)
        mp[stone] = {};

    mp[stones[0]].insert(1);
    int n = stones.size();

    for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
        int curStone = stones[i];

        for(int jump: mp[curStone]){
            int pos = curStone + jump;
            if(pos == stones[n-1])
                return true;

            if(mp.count(pos)){
                if(jump - 1 > 0)
                    mp[pos].insert(jump-1);

                mp[pos].insert(jump);
                mp[pos].insert(jump+1);
            }
        }
    }

    return false;
