### #4. Remove Nth Node From End of List

Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

Problem link: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/

```
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```

**Python (Slow Fast Pointers)**
- This technique initially does padding/shifting "fast" pointer by n steps, and then "slow" and "fast" pointers move together to reach the deletion node.
- Edge case: deletion of the very first node. Happens when "fast" pointer initially reaches null.

```python
def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    slow, fast = head, head
    for _ in range(n):
        fast = fast.next

    # when n = size of the linked list, means to remove first node
    if not fast:
        return head.next

    while fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next

    nodeToDelete = slow.next
    slow.next = slow.next.next

    del nodeToDelete
    return head
```

**Python - Value changing (Not preferred)**
```python
def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
    def index(node):
        if not node:
            return 0
        i = index(node.next) + 1
        if i > n:
            node.next.val = node.val
        return i
    
    index(head)
    return head.next
```
