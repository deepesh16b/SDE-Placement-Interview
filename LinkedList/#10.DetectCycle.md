Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

Leetcode link: https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true

**Solution - CPP**
```cpp
bool hasCycle(Node *root) {
    if (root == NULL) return false;

    Node *slow, *fast;
    slow = fast = root;

    while (slow && fast && fast->next) {
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next->next;

        if (slow == fast) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

**Python**
```python
def hasCycle(self, head):
    try:
        slow = head
        fast = head.next
        
        while slow is not fast:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        return True
    except:
        return False
```
