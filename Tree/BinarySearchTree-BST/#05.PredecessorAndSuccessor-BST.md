### #5. Predecessor and Successor

Problem link: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/predecessor-and-successor/1

```
You need to find the in-order successor and predecessor of a given key.
If either predecessor or successor is not found, then set it to NULL.
```

> Node: This is same as Ceil and Floor - as its BST.

**Solution**
```cpp
void findPreSuc(Node* root, Node*& pre, Node*& suc, int key){
    Node* node = root;
    // Successor
    while(node != NULL){
        if(key >= node->key)
            node = node->right;
        else{
            suc = node;
            node = node->left;
        }
    }
    
    node = root;
    // Predecessor
    while(node != NULL){
        if(key <= node->key)
            node = node->left;
        else{
            pre = node;
            node = node->right;
        }
    }
}
```
